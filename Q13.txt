1. A SQS Queue was created under the name "arun-trial"

2. A lambda function was created under the name "arun-getfromsqs".
   The sqs queue was added as a trigger to the lambda function.

3.Following code was written in the lambda function :-

import json

import boto3


#Creating local s3 variable

s3 = boto3.client('s3')



#Handler Function

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    for s in event['Records']:

    	#Splits the body of the message with delimeter ' ' sent from the SQS

        msg = s['body'].split()

        #Collecting the name of the Resources for the list as following

        #In our convention first we give the src_bucket_name then source_key then target_key

        src_bucket_name = msg[0]

        source_key = msg[1]

        target_key = msg[2]

        #Printing the Resource Names

        print(src_bucket_name)

        print(source_key)

        print(target_key)

        
        #Creating copy_source Dictionary with source details

        copy_source = {
'Bucket': src_bucket_name,'Key': source_key
        }


        #Copying from source to destination folder within same bucket

        s3.copy(copy_source, src_bucket_name, target_key)

4. Source bucket is : arun-s3-2
   Source folder is : A-folder
   Destination folder is : B-folder

5. A message was sent from the queue

6. File got copied from A-folder to B-folder
